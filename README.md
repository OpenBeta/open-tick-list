## Overview

A proposed open standard for climb logbook.

### What we're trying to solve?
- Publish an open format for logging climbs.
- Foster an open source ecosystem of logbook plugins.
- Enable users to import logbooks from other platforms.
- Data privacy and ownership: own your data and only share what you want.
- Visualize & track your progress with community-built charts or code your owns.
